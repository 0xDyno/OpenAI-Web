# OpenAI & Django
This is my first Django project, and I'm excited to learn how to make OpenAI and Django work together!

I'll build a simple web application that uses OpenAI to generate responses to user input. And I'll try to connect image generation as well. After that I'll add functionality to save the result to local database.
