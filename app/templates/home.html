            <tr>
                <td class="links">ChatGPT</td>

                    <p>DALL-E is a neural network-based image generation model developed by OpenAI. It is trained to generate original images from text descriptions, using a dataset of textâ€“image pairs. </p>
                    <p>DALL-E is able to generate a wide range of images, from photorealistic to highly stylized, and can create images of objects and scenes that do not necessarily exist in the real world. It is able to do this by learning to combine the visual features of different objects and scenes in novel ways, based on the text descriptions it receives as input. </p>
                    <p>One of the main benefits of DALL-E is its ability to generate highly creative and original images that go beyond the limits of what is possible with traditional image generation techniques.</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT language model that has been fine-tuned for open-domain chat and dialogue generation. </p>
                    <p>It is able to generate human-like responses to a wide range of inputs, allowing it to hold natural and engaging conversations with users. It can be used in a variety of applications, such as chatbots for customer service or online assistance, or as a conversation partner for language learners. It can assist with a wide range of tasks, including answering questions, providing information, and engaging in conversation. </p>
                    <p>Some specific examples of the types of assistance it can provide include: helping with research, providing language translation, explaining difficult concepts, and offering suggestions and recommendations.</p>
